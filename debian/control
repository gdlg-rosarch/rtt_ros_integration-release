Description: Provides an rtt typekit for ROS stereo_msgs messages. It allows you to use ROS messages transparently in RTT components and applications. This package was automatically generated by the create_rtt_msgs generator and should not be manually modified. See the http://ros.org/wiki/stereo_msgs documentation for the documentation of the ROS messages in this typekit.
