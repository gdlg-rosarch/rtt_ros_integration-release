%description
Provides an rtt typekit for ROS std_msgs messages. It allows you to use ROS
messages transparently in RTT components and applications. This package was
automatically generated by the create_rtt_msgs generator and should not be
manually modified. See the http://ros.org/wiki/std_msgs documentation for the
documentation of the ROS messages in this typekit.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
